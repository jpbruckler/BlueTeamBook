# Introduction

Inspired by the [Red Team Notes](https://dmcxblue.gitbook.io/red-team-notes/) gitbook, this aims to be a location where I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) about things related to "defender" work. Much like the Red Team, Blue Team members need to be jacks of all trades.

> A Jack of all trades is a master of none, but often times better than a master of one.
